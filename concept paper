ZIMCOIN
I am working on a project creates a unique cryptocurrency called ZimCoin (ZZC).  Our plan is to initially connect two very disparate forms of money to each other: 
•	The now defunct Zimbabwe Dollar (Z$), printed in 27 denominations ranging from $1 to $100 trillion. 
•	The leading cryptocurrency BitCoin (BTC). (market value exceeding $1 billion USD) 
We do so by establishing a currency “peg” between the Z$ and the BTC.  We can also link Z$ to other cryptocurrencies such as LiteCoin, NameCoin and PPCoin.  Concurrently, we will be developing ZimCoin as it’s own unique form of cryptocurrency, utilizing the same open-source cryptographic protocol that serves as the backbone to BitCoin.
